AeroTech Storage is a mod for factorio. Its primary purpose is to add compact versions of items and fluids to make storage and transport more convenient.

Note that this repository is not the mod itself, but a shell script for generating the mod.

To add more packageable items, add the icon of the item to the src/graphics-in folder. Make sure that the name of the icon file is consistent with the name of the item.
